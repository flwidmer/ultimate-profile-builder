Now you can create custom profiles on your WordPress site with custom profile fields, front-end registrations and profile listing pages.

== Description ==

Ultimate Profile Builder by CMSHelpLive lets you create and manage profiles on your WordPress site! You can define custom user roles like Authors, Actors, Tennis Players or anything you want. It will also allow visitors to register on the site, fill out custom fields specific to user roles and upload profile images. Their profiles can be edited by the users anytime by logging into the profile area of the site. You can display member profiles as list or box view. The profile view will show image thumbnail, profile snippets and user posts contribution.

All user activity takes place on the front end, and logging in and editing does not requires users to go into the dashboard area. This is especially important if you want your users to have a consistent experience across the website.

Ultimate Profile Builder by CMSHelpLive uses responsive layout and can snug inside your current WordPress template easily. Default theme is light, clean and professional, and will not look out of place on any site. Wherever possible HTML5 and CSS3 are used.

Ultimate Profile Builder by CMSHelpLive uses shortcodes to create different pages, which means it only takes few minutes to set up and integrate with your current site.
